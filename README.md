Sevi Nurafni - Dr. rer. nat. Sparisoma Viridi, S.Si.

<p align"justify">To create dynamic animation to visualize the approximate results of motion and position varying with time of the motion mode of two attached Volvox colonies. The video observation used is from YouTube. Volvox motion mode variations are predicted using a two-body system and then a program is made using Python. </p>
