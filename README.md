# Volvox Colonies Motion Visualization
Sevi Nurafni - Dr. rer. nat. Sparisoma Viridi, S.Si.

<p align"justify">To create dynamic animation to visualize the approximate results of motion and position varying with time of the motion mode of two attached Volvox colonies. The video observation used is from YouTube. This system can be modeled as a two-body system, where its center of mass (COM) is performing simple translational motion, while the two colonies center is rotating around the COM with roll or twist motions.</p>
